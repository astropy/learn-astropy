# Astropy Learn

This repository hosts the homepage of the Astropy Learn project, https://learn.astropy.org and serves the content from the [astropy-tutorials](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-tutorials) repository. The site itself is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and the [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) search service. Records for the Algolia database are curated and formatted by the [learn-astropy-librarian](https://github.com/astropy/learn-astropy-librarian) app.

## Developer guide

### Initial set up

Create a fork on https://github.com/astropy/learn.

```bash
npm install
```

### Run a development server

You can run a development server that will serve the site and reload as you develop the app:

```bash
npm run develop
```

By default the app is hosted at http://localhost:8000. You can also interact with the GraphQL data layer by browsing

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the built site by running:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Linting and autoformatting

This app uses ESLint to lint JavaScript, which in turn runs Prettier to format JavaScript. The configuration is based on [wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos).

A Git pre-commit hooks runs both ESLint and Prettier and automatically lints and reformats code before every commit. These hooks are run by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) and should already be installed when you ran `npm install`.

To manually lint the code base:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To also fix issues and format the code base:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

Ideally your editor will also apply eslint/prettier on save, though these commands are handy as a fallback.

### About the node version

This project is intended to be built with a Node.js version that's encoded in the [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) file. To adopt this Node version, we recommend installing and using the [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Then you can use the preferred node version by running `nvm` from the project root:

```sh
nvm use
```
